            You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains.
            But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning
            and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the
            Web Development Hero.

            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the

              They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
              developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
              it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
              Hero.
